This is a BETA release. Many bugs still exist and quite a few features
are still non-functional. The latest version can be obtained online from:
 - http://metasploit.com/projects/Framework/msf3/

Licensing information can be found in ./documentation/COPYING

This release has only been tested on the following platforms:
 - Linux x86 with Ruby 1.8.2-1.8.4
 - Mac OS X 10.3 with Ruby 1.8.3 from the fink package manager
 - Windows 2000/XP using Cygwin and ruby 1.8.4
 
This release *will not* work with the following platforms:
 - Windows via native Ruby (stdin/readline/io issues abound)
 - Default installs of Mac OS X 10.4 (broken ruby interpreter)

Mac OS X users will not have access to the tab completion
features of the msfconsole interface without installing
the GNU Readline package and rebuilding Ruby from source.
