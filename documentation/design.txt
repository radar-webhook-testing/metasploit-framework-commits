Major subsystems
----------------

rex (lib/rex)

   Contains generic classes that are used by various libraries
   and by framework-core and other subsystems.

framework-core (lib/msf/core)

   Provides the interface for interacting with modules, managing
   sessions, and coordinating exploitation.

framework-base (lib/msf/base)

   Implementations of the default sessions included in the 
   framework, such as Meterpreter, and other various elements
   that are outside of the scope of framework-core.  This
   subsystem also provides a simple wrapper to framework-core
   insofar as dealing with exploitation, encoding, payload,
   and session interaction.
