X     - portfwd command
  - networking
X   - switch board routing table for pivoting
X   - meterpreter 'comm' support
    - proxy 'comm' support
  - asm
    - block dependencies (req'd for shikata)
      - block permutation generation (req'd for shikata)
X - text
X   - create_pattern, pattern_offset
X   - base64
X   - consider extending String
X - logging
X   - debug level limiter
X   - define log levels, when they should be used, etc
- framework-core
X - modules
X   - reloading
X   - compatibility filtering (keys)
X   - description sanitation (strip lines/etc)
X - payloads
X   - meta information
X     - stager/stage calling conventions
X     - stack requirements
X   - make payload prepend target specific
X - sessions
X   - logging session activity
  - module load caching
    - switch to demand loaded modules rather than always loading
    - should make things faster
X - recon
X   - add a method like 'can_be_used' that checks whether or not dependencies are 
X     on the machine (like nmap) for a given module
  - framework task queuing
    - make the framework expose methods for queuing tasks (FrameworkTask)
    - generic interface with an execute method
    - called from within the context of a worker thread
- modules needing ports (above other modules)
  - encoders
    - shikata
X - nops
X   - opty2
  - payloads
    - cmd payloads
X   - mac os x payloads
      - osx null free reverse stager
X   - solaris payloads
X   - bsd payloads
- user interfaces
  - general
X   - add concept of EVASION option (high, normal, low)
X   - logging improvements
X     - provide log file setting interface
X     - log by default in the LogDir
X - msfcli
  - msfweb
X - msfpayload
X - msfencode
  - msfconsole
    - spawn web-server from within msfconsole (msfweb instance)
    - irb mode
    - running 'msf scripts'
- testing framework
  - framework core
X   - handlers
  - framework modules
    - exploits
    - payloads
X   - encoders
      - osx encoders
    - nops
    - recon
  - framework sessions
    - shell
    - meterpreter
- documentation
  - rex
  - framework-core
  - framework-base
  - module interfaces

The following things should be implemented both as protocols and as exploit
mixins to encourage code re-use:

- ftp
- backup agent protocols
  - CA brightstor
  - Arkeia
- mssql
- sunrpc
- xdr
- jbase
- oracle

Things that would be useful to have completed, but not a requirement:

- rex
  - exploitation
    - format string generator
    - opcodedb client (return addr pooling)
  - networking
    - msfd 'comm' support
- modules
  - payloads
    - implement 'reliable' stagers with a higher rating so that
      if there is enough room, reliable stagers can be used
  - recon
X   - basic range/port scanner
X   - basic service identifier
    - basic OS fingerprinting
- framework-core
  - handler sharing
    - exploits using the same payload/handler can share (ref count)
  - plugin modules
    - plugin modules can extend the framework and provide new features
X - framework-base
X   - event correlation
X     - recon events correlations
- user interfaces
  - msfd
    - daemon interface, provides command line interaction and proxying
    - support authentication
    - support SSL
