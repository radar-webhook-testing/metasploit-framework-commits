The following things are required for the December alpha release:

- rex
X - post-exploitation
X   - meterpreter
X     - pivoting
X     - portfwd command
  - networking
X   - switch board routing table for pivoting
    - meterpreter 'comm' support
    - proxy 'comm' support
  - asm
    - block dependencies (req'd for shikata)
      - block permutation generation (req'd for shikata)
  - text
    - create_pattern, pattern_offset
    - base64
    - consider extending String
- framework-core
  - modules
    - reloading
    - compatibility filtering (keys)
    - description sanitation (strip lines/etc)
  - payloads
    - meta information
      - stager/stage calling conventions
      - stack requirements
    - make payload prepend target specific
  - sessions
    - logging session activity
  - handler sharing
    - exploits using the same payload/handler can share (ref count)
- modules needing ports (above other modules)
  - encoders
    - shikata
  - nops
    - opty2
  - payloads
    - mac os x payloads
    - solaris payloads
    - bsd payloads
- user interfaces
  - general
    - add concept of EVASION option (high, normal, low)
    - logging improvements
      - provide log file setting interface
      - log by default in the LogDir
  - msfcli
  - msfweb
  - msfpayload
  - msfencode
  - msfconsole
    - spawn web-server from within msfconsole (msfweb instance)
    - irb mode
    - running 'msf scripts'
- testing framework
  - framework core
    - handlers
  - framework modules
    - exploits
    - payloads
    - encoders
    - nops
    - recon
  - framework sessions
    - shell
    - meterpreter
- documentation
  - rex
  - framework-core
  - framework-base
  - module interfaces

The following things should be implemented both as protocols and as exploit
mixins to encourage code re-use:

- ftp
- backup agent protocols
  - CA brightstor
  - Arkeia
- mssql
- sunrpc
- xdr
- jbase
- oracle

Things that would be useful to have completed, but not a requirement:

- rex
  - exploitation
    - format string generator
    - opcodedb client (return addr pooling)
  - networking
    - msfd 'comm' support
- modules
  - payloads
    - implement 'reliable' stagers with a higher rating so that
      if there is enough room, reliable stagers can be used
  - recon
    - basic range/port scanner
    - basic service identifier
    - basic OS fingerprinting
- framework-base
  - event correlation
    - recon events correlations
- user interfaces
  - msfd
    - daemon interface, provides command line interaction and proxying
    - support authentication
    - support SSL
