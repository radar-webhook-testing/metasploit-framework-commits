This release of the Metasploit Framework source code is provided under
the terms of the Metasploit Framework License, version 1.2. This license
can be found in the file 'LICENSE', located in the same directory as this
document. The Metasploit Framework License is closer to a commercial software
EULA than a standard open-source license. The basic intent is:

1) Allow the Framework to remain open-source, free to use, and free to 
distribute.

2) Allow module and plugin developers to choose their own licensing terms.

3) Prevent the Framework from being sold in any form or bundled with a 
commercial product (software, appliance, or otherwise).

4) Ensure that any patches made to the Framework by a third-party are made
available to all users. 

5) Provide legal support and indemnification for Framework contributors.

Please see the actual license for details.
