What are the three most important reasons why this is a quality Black Hat talk?

Reason 1:

	There have been many presentations on certain exploitation methods, and
development.  There hasn't been any presentations really discussing a lot of
work on the little details that have really improved the modern exploit usage.
Our talk will concentrate less on "this is how you exploit IIS", and more on
technologies that are required for any attack, and how to further advance in
this arena.  We will discuss new ideas and implementations in post-exploitation,
IDS evasion, and the future of hacking related technologies.

-- these suck, but I sort of want to touch on how we will be different/good --

-- or something like --

	Although we continue to publically release much of our work, there is
much more involved than just what's released.  Blackhat is the perfect venue to
discuss our ideas, research, design, and development in a detail.  It's really
important to be able to discuss the sort of things we've thought very hard
about, and present a conclusions that would otherwise be taken for granted.

Reason 2:
	
	The technology discussed in this presentation impacts a wide number of 
security related fields including NIDS, HIPS, Anti-Virus, penetration
testing and the general exploit development cycle.

Reason 3:

	Many of the audience members can't be fully engaged in the deep world
of security research.  This is a chance for them to get a "view the trenches",
and see what's actually happening on the attacker security front.  Where
technologies currently stand, and where things are going in the future.

Is there a demonstration? Yes or No

	Yes

Are the speaker(s) releasing a new tool? Yes or No

	Possibly, or will talk about many recent (within a year) releases.

Are the speaker(s) releasing a new exploit? Yes or No

	No

Is there audience participation? Yes or No

	No

What are your equipment needs?

	1 projector.

Will you require more than 2 lcd projectors? Yes or No - if yes, please specify
how many

	No

Will you require internet access? Yes or No

	No

Will you require a white board? Yes or No

	No

Will you require any special equipment? Yes or No - if yes, please specify.

	No
