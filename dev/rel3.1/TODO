This file will hold the sweet things we plan on including in the 3.1 release:

 - Remote Ruby (skape)
   - Server-side Ruby provided as a Meterpreter extension
	- Arbitrary Ruby code execution on remote machines
 - Local Exploits (skape)
   - While 3.0 "supports" local exploits, it really hasn't been flushed out
	- Design support so that local exploits can be proxied to remote machines
	  using dN/meterp
 - Local Payloads (skape)
   - Needed to nicely support local exploits
	- Framework should classify local and remote payloads so that they are
	  hidden from exploits that they aren't applicable to
