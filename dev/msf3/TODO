This file contains things that need to be done that aren't in the plan:

- revisit pivoting
  - connections seemed slow
  - data transfers seemed slow

Buggies:
	- With no target set, the user can still show payloads and do tab completion
	  in msfconsole. All payloads are listed, so this can be confusing and
	  result in the wrong payload being selected. If we add some kind of warning
	  or just refuse to show payloads w/o a target, it would solve this.
	  
	- An exploit that has Compat = -find in the Payload section will still list
	  meterpreter's find_tag payload as compatible

	- The target info should provide a packing function that matches the arch and
	  platform set in the target. Right now all exploits are calling big or little
	  packers on the target, regardless of the target arch.
