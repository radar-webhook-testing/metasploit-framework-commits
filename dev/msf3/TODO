This file contains things that need to be done that aren't in the plan:

- revisit pivoting
  - connections seemed slow
  - data transfers seemed slow

Buggies:
	  
	- An exploit that has Compat = -find in the Payload section will still list
	  meterpreter's find_tag payload as compatible

	- The target info should provide a packing function that matches the arch and
	  platform set in the target. Right now all exploits are calling big or little
	  packers on the target, regardless of the target arch.
	
	- If the Authors is supplied as an array, with only a single author, and
	  that author isnt in the known list, a crash will occur.
