<b>Scheduled alpha preview release:</b> December 15th, 2005<br/>
<br/>
Metasploit 3.0 is the next generation of the Metasploit Framework.  It is written
in the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> programming language.
As it stands, the 2.0 branch has made it possible to drastically reduce the
amount of time it takes to implement an exploit with the added benefit of making
it possible to re-use large amounts of code between various exploits.  The
extensible model through which payloads, encoders, NOP generators, and exploits
can be integrated has made it possible to use the Metasploit Framework as an
outlet for cutting-edge exploitation research.<br/> 
<br/>
In this light, the 3.0 version is being planned to help continue to evolve
the field of exploitation research and exploitation frameworks in general.
The primary goals of the 3.0 version are listed below:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>To improve automation of exploitation through scripting
	<li>To simplify the process of writing an exploit
	<li>To increase code re-use between exploits
	<li>To improve and generically integrate evasion techniques
	<li>To support automated network discovery and event correlation through <i>recon</i> modules
	<li>To continue to provide a friendly outlet to cutting edge exploitation technology
</ul>
As we get closer to the preview release date, we will begin posting design
documentation and other information that will allow the community to assess
the new architecture and provide feedback.  The preview release will simply
be used as a milestone by which the public can help us to gauge how much 
work remains until we feel comfortable that we have a finished product.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, here are some screenshots of the 3.0 release in development.  Nothing
too fancy at this point, but it highlights some of the upcoming changes.<br/>
