Things to *not* do in ruby that will break ruby threads.  This list 
isn't complete, but it's things I've noticed while working on stuff:

- select with no timeout

  This will make a blocking select call that will block all other 
  threads.

  Use Rex::ThreadSafe::select

- use sleep

  This will block all threads.

  Use Rex::ThreadSafe::sleep (we've now wrapped the global sleep to
  call the rex sleep)
