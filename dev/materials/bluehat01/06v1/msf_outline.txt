Title:

	Metasploit^3

Intro:
	
	Who
		BreakingPoint
		Metasploit
	What
		Exploit framework evolution
		
	Why
		Exploits are commodities
		Integration is the tricky part
		Who needs a shell when...
		Merge of two distinct users
			Network admins
			Penetration testers

Exploit Frameworks
	Development platform for exploit code
	Shrink exploit development time
	Enable security research
	Automation

Metasploit
	Started off with ~7 exploits
	v1 - 2,000 lines of perl
	v2 - 40,000 lines of perl, 3,000 asm, 7,000 C
	v3 - 80,000 lines of perl, 4,000 asm, 12,000 C
	Exploit launcher
		Modular components
		Consistent interface
		Three UI's
Metasploit^3
	Complete rewrite in the Ruby language
	Code compression ~40%
	Completely OO, no more dirty perl tricks
	Focused on simplicity, consistency, extensibility

Architecture
	Rex Library
	MSF Library
	MSF Core
	MSF Interfaces

Libraries
	Create your own MSF app in ~5 lines of code :-)
	Simple to work with any module programatically
	Write standalone security apps using our libs

Concepts
	Interfaces
		Load and interact with modules
	Jobs
		Modules running in the background
	Sessions
		Interactive shells and more
Modules
	Payloads
	Encoders
	Nops
	Exploits
	Auxiliary
	
Plugins
	Extend anything at runtime
	
Examples
	Reconnaisance module
	Passive exploit modules
	Handling multiple sessions
