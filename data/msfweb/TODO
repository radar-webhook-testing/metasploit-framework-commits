lmh & hdm:
	- IDE
		- wizard
			- describe ALL steps
			- describe the options to be available
			- flow chart extremely useful:
				graphviz. simple.
				(show every possible path/data set in wizard)
				my brain eats diagrams.

		- advanced editor
			- not yet started
			- options implemented as 'slide' panels
			- main text area shows code in real time
			- direct access to opcodes:
				- calculate hex values from pure asm
				- retrieve opcodes from db
					- ajax search
			- drag and drop functionality.

	- Exploits in msfweb
		- linear:
			select target
			select options
			select payload
			profit

	- Msfweb 'msfconsole' (javascript term emulation)
		- evaluation of existing possibilities necessary
		- once implementaton is decided, it's EASY.
			- ajax callback (stdout emulation)
			- terminal (container with scroll back)
			- error logger: external panel? floating?
		- rock on
