#
# This class encapsulates a LogicalBlock permutation.  Block permutations can
# take the form of a static string or a procedure.  This makes it possible to
# have simple blocks and more complicated ones that take into account other
# variables, such as dynamic registers.  The to_s method will return the
# string version of the permutation, regardless of whether or not the
# underlying permutation is a string or a procedure.
#

class Permutation

	#
	# Initializes the permutation and its associated block.
	#
	def initialize(perm, block)
		@perm  = perm
		@block = block
	end

	#
	# Returns the length of the string returned by to_s.
	#
	def length
		to_s.length
	end

	#
	# Returns the string representation of the permutation.  If the underlying
	# permutation is a procedure, the procedure is called.  Otherwise, the
	# string representation of the permutation is returned.
	#

#
# This class represents a logical block which is defined as a concise portion
# of code that may have one or more functionally equivalent implementations.
# A logical block should serve a very specific purpose, and any permutations
# beyond the first should result in exactly the same functionality without any
# adverse side effects to other blocks.  
#
# Like blocks of code, LogicalBlock's can depend on one another in terms of
# ordering and precedence.  By marking blocks as dependent on another, a
# hierarchy begins to form.  This is a block dependency graph.
#
# To add permutations to a LogicalBlock, they can either be passed in as a
# list of arguments to the constructor following the blocks name or can be
# added on the fly by calling the add_perm method.  To get a random
# permutation, the rand_perm method can be called.
#
# To mark one block as depending on another, the depends_on method can be
# called with zero or more LogicalBlock instances as parameters.
#
